# Evaluating-Activation-Functions-for-Neural-Network-Performance-on-the-Iris-Dataset
This project explores the effect of different activation functions on the performance of a neural network trained on the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a well-known classification dataset consisting of 150 samples across three species of Iris flowers, with four features per sample.
